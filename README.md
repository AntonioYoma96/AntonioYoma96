## Hi there 👋 I'm Antonio Yoma

I'm a Civil Engineer in Computer Science from Universidad de Los Lagos 🇨🇱, passionate about building fullstack web applications that solve real-world problems.

- 💻 I have experience developing internal task management systems for public institutions using technologies like **Angular**, **ASP.NET (C#)**, **JavaScript**, and **SQL Server**.
- 🛠️ I'm comfortable working across the full web stack — from creating responsive interfaces to implementing efficient backend logic and working with relational databases.
- 🌱 I’m currently expanding my skills in **Node.js**, **Django**, and **RESTful API** design.
- 📁 I love building organized and scalable codebases that are easy to maintain.
- 🌐 I'm interested in real-world web solutions, collaborative projects, and continuous learning.
- 📫 You can reach me at: yomaraddatz96@gmail.com
